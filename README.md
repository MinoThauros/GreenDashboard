# Final submission: thoughts
 - performance charts buttons could be made into a single reusable component; standardize and entralize interactive UI pieces through the app
 - Folder stucture is messy; could use some cleanup
 - Will generate an openApi backend side and use overval to generate hooks frontend side; from there custom hooks wrapping the orval api call hooks and applying adapter patterns on them to effortlessly populate the UI
